# Project Title: Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) Analysis

## Overview:
This project delves into the intricacies of the Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT), a fundamental tool in signal processing and analysis. The goal is to comprehensively understand the DTFT, its properties, and its applications through theoretical exploration, MATLAB simulations, and visual representations.

## Project Components:
1. **LaTeX Report**: A detailed report written in LaTeX, outlining the theoretical foundations of the DTFT, its mathematical formulation, properties, and significance in signal analysis. This report will provide a comprehensive understanding of the DTFT and its role in digital signal processing.

2. **PowerPoint Presentation (PPT)**: A visually engaging presentation summarizing key concepts, properties, and applications of the DTFT. The PPT will serve as an effective tool for presenting our findings to peers, instructors, or stakeholders.

3. **MATLAB Graphs and Plots**: Utilizing MATLAB, we will generate various graphs and plots to demonstrate the behavior of signals under DTFT analysis. These visuals will aid in illustrating key concepts such as frequency-domain representation, spectral properties, and convolution in the context of discrete-time signals.

## Objectives:
- Gain a deep understanding of the mathematical principles underlying the DTFT.
- Explore the relationship between time-domain and frequency-domain representations of discrete-time signals.
- Investigate the properties of the DTFT, including linearity, time shifting, frequency shifting, and convolution.
- Analyze practical applications of the DTFT in signal processing, such as filtering, modulation, and spectral analysis.
